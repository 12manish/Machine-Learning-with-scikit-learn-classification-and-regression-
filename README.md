# Machine-Learning-with-scikit-learn-classification-and-regression-
In this project I have loaded the toy dataset(sklearn dataset-wind, digits,cancer,iris,california,lingured) that we load by sklearn. Then we have perform the classification and regression on toy data set. Here we have perform linear regression, random forest , knn, SVR, Decision tree classifiers , Gaussian naïve bias , MLP classifier (neural network) etc. Here we have check the performance of model, accuracy of model, MSE (mean square value), by using t-test and p-value by using mlxtend package check the best algorithm which has highest performance.. I have seen random KNN classifier has highest mean AUC values and so we can say KNN classifier has highest performance than other classifiers on California data. “mlxtend” is important package to test the model , which has highest performance of model.
